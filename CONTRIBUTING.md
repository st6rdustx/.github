# Contributing

My projects are open to contributions. It might take me a bit to review your work (I'm just one person after all). I'm usually prioritizing bug fixes, but I genuinely love hearing from the community and appreciate all your support!

## Features

Got a cool feature idea? **Open an Issue** before diving into a pull request. This gives me a chance to think about the change and provide feedback before you spend time coding something that might not fit. When I'm ready for new features, I'll check through the open Issues.

## Refactoring

If you're refactoring code, please include a quick explanation of what you changed and how it makes the project better. Nothing fancy, just enough context so I understand your thinking.

## Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Open an Issue with a clear title and description.
The more details you provide, the faster I can fix it!

## Bug Fixes

Found a bug? When reporting or fixing it, please include clear steps to show the issue before and after your fix. Even a simple list of steps to reproduce is super helpful!

## Pull Request Hygiene

All contributions need to pass CI before merging.

If you're having trouble with failing CI and can't figure it out, just mention it in your PR. Otherwise, I'll assume it's still a work in progress.

Only mark your PR as "Ready for Review" when it's actually... well, ready for review.

## Code style

For commit messages, please use conventional commits[^1] to keep release notes clean and organized.
