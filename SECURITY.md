# Reporting Security Issues

I take security flaws seriously and appreciate you helping keep the open source community safer by reporting them responsibly.

To report a security issue, drop me a line at [hi@diogo.wtf](mailto:hi@diogo.wtf). I'll get back to you if I need more details or have questions about fixing the issue.

Found a security bug in a third-party module? Please report it directly to the people maintaining that module instead of me as they'll be in a better position to address it.
